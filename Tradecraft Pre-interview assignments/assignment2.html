	<h3>Assignment 2- Creating a mock-up of a multi-page signup and checkout flow</h3>
	<div id="writeupassignment2">
				<p>This assignment is about creating a responsive website for a vegetable delivering service, to the homes of people living in the food desert areas, where access to fresh produce is difficult. These areas usually have a corner store which hardly carries fresh produce. They carry packaged food and frozen meats. Here is a website attempting to make buying fresh produce easy, user friendly and quick. The objective is helping the people order online and have produce delivered to their doorstep. In designing the flow of the website I followed the following steps</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Learn</li>
			<li>Plan</li>
			<li>Design</li>
			<li>Code</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Step 1. Learn</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>To understand and learn more about the user a questionair was created based on which the various elements of the website would be created</p>

		<h3>Step 2. Plan</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>Before starting to create a wireframe and a mockup it helped hugely to draw sketches to understand what I was trying to acheive and how I could get there.<br> 
		Here are a few sketches of my thought process</p>
		<div class= "clearfix" id="sketchesgallery">
		<a href= "images/sketch1.jpg" class="fancybox" rel="group">Sketch 1</a>
		<a href= "images/sketch2.jpg" class="fancybox" rel="group">Sketch 2</a>
		<a href= "images/sketch3.jpg" class="fancybox" rel="group">Sketch 3</a>
		<a href= "images/sketch4.jpg" class="fancybox" rel="group">Sketch 4</a>
		<a href= "images/sketch5.jpg" class="fancybox" rel="group">Sketch 5</a>
		</div>

		<h3>Step 3. Design</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>Wireframes<br>
		Sketches helped me decide everything that needed to go into a website and the flow of things. Wireframes helped decide the hierarchy of elements and what would go where. It was very important that the whole website be very easy to navigate and does not take too much time to load with few images. Inserting an element that showed the user the steps being followed was critical in the feel of the website.<br>
		Here are the wireframe images and a interactive prototype created in marvel:</p>

		<a href="https://marvelapp.com/b45663">Sites Wireframes on iphone6</a>

		<p>Mockups<br>
		Wireframes once built gave a better idea of how the site would look and function. It was time to decide onto how the site would look and feel to the end user. By importing images form the internet I have created a dummy website which looks like the final website.<br>
		Here are the mockup images and a interactive prototype created in marvel:</p>

		<br>
		<br>
		<p>Following the above pattern I have created a website which has the following pages</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Landing page</li>
			<li>Selection Page</li>
			<li>Signup Page</li>
			<li>Create account page</li>
			<li>Confirm and checkout</li>
			<li>Thankyou and confirmation page</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The objective of the assignment was to start designing from the signup/subscribe page however in understanding the flow of things and for the user to get inspired to embrace this almost new way of eating I started my first page with  selecting a box of colorful produce and then signing up and proceeding to checkout.</p>
