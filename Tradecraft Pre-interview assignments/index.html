		<h3>Hello!!!</h3>
		<p>I am Sonia Bhatia, a mother of two, a wife and a designer. Designing and finding ways to make stuff work in a more easy and seamless manner is my passion. As a trained architect from Mumbai, India I worked in the U.S for 5 years before taking a break to have kids, never the less I did not stop designing. I worked on a free lance basis for my project manager, passed my LEED,AP exam for creating green and clean building designs along with learning marketing skills from   U.C Berkeley,ext. It is during this time that I learnt more about User experience design/Interaction design/product design and got interested in learning more about it. I started off with learning HTML/CSS to understand website design and took a workshop in Javascript and Jquery.
		I have completed the two assignments given to me and for the second assignment I have designed the subscribe and checkout flow for a vegetable delivery service for food desert areas. I do not have very relevant design experience and so took up the assignment given. Most of my design work is in form of technical drawings which were worked upon a few years ago. Kindly have a look at my two assignments. Thankyou !</p>
