		<h3>Hello!!!</h3>
		<p>I am Sonia Bhatia, a mother, a wife and a designer. Designing and finding ways to make stuff work in a more easy and seamless manner is my passion. As an Architect from Mumbai, India I worked in the U.S for 5 years before taking a break to have kids, never the less I did not stop designing. I worked on a free lance basis for my project manager, passed my LEED,AP exam for creating green and clean building designs along with learning marketing skills from U.C Berkeley,ext. It is during this time that I learnt more about User experience design/Interaction design/product design and got interested in learning more about it. I started off with learning HTML/CSS to understand website design and took a workshop in Javascript and Jquery. 
		I have started designing my own websites and decided to do my presentation in HTML and CSS for it is something i have learnt recently and only made sense for me to put it into use immediately.</p>
